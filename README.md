## Why Appsmith?

Today when we need an internal app, our choices are limited to

* Invest weeks of time building it from scratch and fighting with HTML/CSS
* Getting started with an admin panel and invest even more time customising it

Appsmith bridges the gap between [getting started](quick-start.md) super quickly and making customisations super easy! The best part?

### _No HTML / CSS!_

## How fast is it?

Appsmith makes building internal tools as easy as

* Drag and configure the UI (No HTML / CSS!)
* Connect APIs / Databases
* Write snippets of business logic

Check out our demo video to see how easy it is!
